### **Abstract**

This project proposes the installation of a small-scale anaerobic digester (biodigester). This is a reactor that breaks down biodegradable organic waste producing biogas. Food waste is considered one of the most efficient for producing biogas of typical biodigester feedstocks (Poschl, 2010). The UR Dining Hall produces 614 lbs of food waste per day to be used as feedstock, with landscaping scraps available for additional feed. The University boiler plant is capable of using biogas for heat production, making the plant a suitable destination for the digester's waste output. The digester may allow for waste diversion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions while also saving money on transportation and natural gas.

### **Main Takeaways**

Based on our analysis, the implementation of a biodigester on campus would provide a
variety of benefits to the University, while also helping to achieve the University's goals in waste
and GHG emission reductions. We propose diverting pre- and post-consumer waste from HDC,
along with input from landscaping, to the biodigester. Each student produces 2.0-2.6 ounces of
waste per meal, times 30,000 customers a week (roughly). This equates to 3,750 pounds of postconsumer food waste per week, to be supplemented by 3,000-5,000 pounds per week of preconsumer food waste, and varied but negligible amounts of landscaping scraps. Assuming the minimum amount of operating weeks for the University in Fall and Spring semesters at 30 weeks, HDC is producing 56 tons of food waste annually, all of which could go to the digester. This would produce 1,487 MCF of biogas per year. We propose diverting the produced biogas to the steam plant on campus, to be mixed with natural gas to produce cleaner heat energy. This output would save the University $5,052.78 on natural gas and transportation costs annually.
