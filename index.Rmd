My name is Joe Walderman and I am a first year master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. From New York City, to Washington DC, to Telluride and now Santa Barbara I have worked to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and foster energy independence in local communities. You will usually find me out in the mountains skiing or biking, or inside trying to train my bonsai.
